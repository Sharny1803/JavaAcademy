# JavaAcademy
This is a test exercise for a Java academy in my company.

This program counts the number of each letter in the string and present the results to the console.

Start by using cmd and typing:

java -jar JavaAcademy-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

If this does not work try specifying the file directory or "Git BASH here" inside the folder the file is in.
